# airbnb_price_predict

This project uses data engineering and machine learning techniques to create a predictive model for Airbnb listings in the Madrid community.

The data can be found [here](https://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data/). This project uses the principal archive of Madrid Airbnb listings "listings.csv.gz", consisting of both numeric, categorical, and text data pertaining to each listing.
